# CSS image stack cycle (infinitely cycling)

A Pen created on CodePen.

Saw [this post](https://bsky.app/profile/jason.energy/post/3lerm35xw4c25) on Bluesky about reacreating [this image stack cycle](https://www.toni.li/about), so I gave it [a quick go](https://bsky.app/profile/anatudor.bsky.social/post/3les4qimla22z).

Uses compact HTML, just a bunch of article elements with a heading, some text and an image plus two navigation buttons.

The JS is only ~200 bytes minified and all it does is update the current top item index on clicking one of the buttons.

The CSS uses variables, mathematical functions, grid, subgrid and a bunch of other recent goodies.

Then the next day, I polished it and heavily commented it.
