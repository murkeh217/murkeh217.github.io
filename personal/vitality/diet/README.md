Click the info button in the bottom right corner. ðŸ˜¼ WebKit-only because other browsers have poor support for using `calc()` in place of anything else other than length values. Mentioned in my CSS-Tricks article [Solving the Last Item Problem for a Circular Distribution with Partially Overlapping Items ](https://css-tricks.com/solving-last-item-problem-circular-distribution-partially-overlapping-items/).

If the work I've been putting out since early 2012 has helped you in any way or you just like it, then please remember that praise doesn't keep me afloat financially... but you can! So please consider supporting my work in one of the following ways:

* being a cool cat ðŸ˜¼ðŸŽ© and supporting it monthly on Ko-fi or via a one time donation

[![ko-fi](https://assets.codepen.io/2017/btn_kofi.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/anatudor)

* making a weekly anonymous donation via Liberapay - I'll never know who you are if that's your wish

* getting me a chocolate voucher

* if you're from outside Europe, becoming a patron on Patreon (don't use it for one time donations or if you're from Europe, we're both getting ripped off)

* or at least sharing this to show the world what can be done with CSS these days

Thank you!
