# Murtaza (MK) Kanorwala – Portfolio

This site reflects my journey as a game creator, tester, web designer, and communicator. It’s both a showcase and a live portfolio of where my skills meet creativity and execution.

The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, combining custom code and design templates with guidance and refinements made through ChatGPT. It serves as a blend of human creativity and AI assistance — demonstrating how ideas can evolve from concept to a clean, functional web experience.
